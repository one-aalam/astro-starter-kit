# Welcome to [Astro](https://astro.build) Starter Kit

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
|   |-- style/
│   └── favicon.ico and other files
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── BlogPreview.astro, Podcast.astro, and other such components
│   └── pages/
│   |   └── index.astro, and other pages
│   └── layouts/
│       └── page.astro, and other layout components
│   └── data/
│       └── static data files (json)
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components could be found.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run start` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
